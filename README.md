### This is a simple tool to create Discord timestamps.

Discord timestamps are automatically updating parts in your message. Every user will see these in their timezone.
Choose whatever date and time you want, copy the code and paste it in your Discord message.
Done!

The `is_production` flag in the `config.json` just controls the console output when starting the app. If it's set to `false`, you will see a localhost URL that are helpful during development. Otherwise, you will see just the port it is launching on, which is helpful for the setup on your server.
